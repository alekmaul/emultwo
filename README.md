E.mul T.wo - A Colecovision and ADAM Emulator for Windows
The aim of this emulator is to help developers to make Colecovision games. 
The aim is not to add a great emulator to play colecovision games, but to help me and others debugging our code.

If you find a bug or want new features, you can help me [opening an issue](https://github.com/alekmaul/emultwo/issues).

This is an open source project.

_**Your Vision Is Our Vision...  COLECOVISION**_
