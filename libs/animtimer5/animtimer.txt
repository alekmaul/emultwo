AnimTimer - fast timer component
----------------------------------
(c) 1996-2000 Lucian Wischik


AnimTimer is a fast multi-threaded timer for animation.
It behaves like a regular Timer but has two differences:
 - You can set it to go a lot faster. If the computer isn't
   up to the speed you ask of it, it will do the best it can.
 - It doesn't interferes with user-responsiveness. This timer
   runs at a priority level slightly lower than that of the
   user interface. Hence your timer events will never make
   the application appear sluggish.
There is one other small difference. Setting Interval to the
special value of -1 means 'go flat out uncooperatively'.

Source code for AnimTimer is included in the LIB
directory. There's also an example application
(to demonstrate the difference between
AnimTimer and a regular timer).

You're free to use AnimTimer in any way you wish.
There are no restrictions on its use.
